<!-- Updates -->
## ‚è© Updates

**12/26/2024**
- Release [**TRELLIS-500K**](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS#-dataset) dataset and toolkits for data preparation.

**12/18/2024**
- Implementation of multi-image conditioning for TRELLIS-image model. ([#7](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/issues/7)). This is based on tuning-free algorithm without training a specialized model, so it may not give the best results for all input images.
- Add Gaussian export in `app.py` and `example.py`. ([#40](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/issues/40))

<!-- TODO List -->
## üöß TODO List
- [x] Release inference code and TRELLIS-image-large model
- [x] Release dataset and dataset toolkits
- [ ] Release TRELLIS-text model series
- [ ] Release training code
## Model Description

## Model Description
TRELLIS uses a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation that enables generation of different 3D output formats. The model deployed here is TRELLIS-image-large, which contains 1.2B parameters and is trained on a diverse dataset of 500K 3D objects.

### Troubleshooting

If you cannot `cog push` in Docker Desktop, try disabling containerd.

### Web Demo

[app.py](app.py) provides a simple web demo for 3D asset generation. Since this demo is based on [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), additional dependencies are required:
```sh
. ./setup.sh --demo
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the demo with the following command:
```sh
python app.py
```

Then, you can access the demo at the address shown in the terminal.

***The web demo is also available on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS)!***
